# Pokiwar FG38 art - remaining batches for Codex

Paste ONE batch per NEW Codex thread. Each batch stays under 25 generated images, because a thread that
carries more inline images exceeds the 64 MiB request limit (`Encoded request body exceeds 67108864 bytes`)
and cannot be used again.

## Rule for this file

This file lists ONLY what is still to paint. When a batch is painted its prompt is deleted from here and the
batch moves to the "Already painted" table below - never leave a finished prompt in place, Codex would paint it
again. Before painting anything, check the file name under `D:\Project\Pokiwar_Art_FG38\Assets`: a file that
exists is finished, do not repaint or overwrite it unless the user asks for a new version by name.

## Still to paint (checked 2026-10-06 15:30 against `D:\Project\Pokiwar_Art_FG38\Assets`)

Nothing. Every image ordered so far is painted and in the game. New orders are added below as new batches.

## Already painted - do NOT repaint

| 13 | town map | `Meta/Background`, `Meta/Home` | `home_bg_town_v01.png`, `home_{hunt,arena,evolve,challenge,shopcard,shopavatar,gift,wheel,rank}_v01.png` |

Do NOT paint either (decided 2026-10-06, they would never be shown): second forms for Emberkit, Leafling or
Tidepup - the free starter never changes form and the other two are not obtainable; a card for Tidal Siphon -
only the boss uses it and boss cards are not drawn.

## Shared preamble (put at the top of every batch)

```
Continue the Pokiwar FG38 art set. Reply to me in Vietnamese.
Read first: D:\Project\Pokiwar_Art_FG38\ART_BIBLE.md, AssetManifest.json, and look at
D:\Project\Pokiwar_Art_FG38\Previews\Battle_form01_v01.png as the style target (canyon fantasy, chunky
silhouettes, near-black brown outline #21191F, two or three flat shade bands, cream highlight).
Thread budget rules - this thread dies above ~30 inline images:
- generate at most the images listed below, one at a time;
- never open a full-size output to check it; build a 512 px contact sheet and view only that;
- copy every accepted image out of ~/.codex/generated_images/<session>/ into the exact path below at
  once, with a transparent background, and update AssetManifest.json for it.
The game picks files up by these exact names (Fg38Art in D:\Project\GitHub\Match_3_Unity); do not rename.
Do not edit anything inside D:\Project\GitHub\Match_3_Unity.
```

## After any batch

Tell Claude Code "lấy asset Codex mới vào game" (or run `Pokiwar/Rebuild Scene + Art` in Unity). Painted
square gems replace the code-drawn ones automatically; everything else fills the matching sprite key.
